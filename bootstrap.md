General Boostrap
================

iTerm2 - Improved Terminal App for Mac.
---------------------------------------
* [Download](http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/downloads/list), extract, and run to open an iTerm window, but it's also installed.
* Solarized Colors - [Iterm2 instructions in repo](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/iterm2-colors-solarized/README.md)


Version Control
---------------
* git
    - Distributed VCS (Version Control System.)
    - Install w/ package manager.
* gitsubtree
    - Allows for easier git subtree merges. I like this a lot more than git submodules for things like drupal.
    - [Install](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree)
